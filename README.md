### **SOC Automation Lab**

🚀 **SOC Automation Lab Project Completed**

I recently built a fully functional **Security Operations Center (SOC) Automation Lab**, designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity operations.

🔑 **Key Skills Developed:**

- Designed and diagrammed a complete SOC environment from scratch
    
- Configured **Wazuh** for event collection and integrated **SOAR automation** with **Shuffle**
    
- Implemented **case management** using **TheHive** for alert triage and response
    
- Mapped and automated incident workflows from detection to containment
    
- Strengthened troubleshooting and research skills through hands-on scenarios
    
🛠️ **Tools Used:** Wazuh | Shuffle | TheHive | draw.io | Windows 10

✅ **Outcome:** Gained practical, end-to-end SOC experience—covering monitoring, alert enrichment, case handling, and automated response actions—boosting my confidence in both technical skills and interview readiness for cybersecurity analyst roles.
